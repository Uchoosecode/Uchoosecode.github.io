For this project I used React with Redux.  What I enjoy the most about React is using Components.  Components let you split the UI into reusable pieces. Also the introduction of JSX very useful.  The mixture of HTML and Javascript makes everything more understandable while you're in the development phase.  Using yarn start also let you seeing your project all coming together live while you're coding is helpful with using inline declarations and CSS.  The addition of Redux takes our data and puts it in one place. Turning everything into normal Javascript objects.  Armed with everything I've learned I am ready for the next step in this journey now ...to be continued!
