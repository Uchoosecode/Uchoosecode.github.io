I really enjoyed this project.  I decided to create an organizer for a Project Manager. The user will be able to create a project file, have access to all their projects, edit their projects and delete a project.  Though this project didn't require CSS, it is a good introduction into website development.  Using MVC in conjuction with ActiveRecord, Rack and Sinatra was so much fun and educating.  Putting together all that we learned about classes, inheritances and methods makes this process make more sense with the flow of Learn.  Make me feel more confident that I'm with the right Bootcamp to become the best software engineer I can be.
