For this project I decide to create an Art Museum where artist of all kinds can showcase their beautiful artwork.  Working on this project gave me great understanding of the reason Flatiron lead us through the curriculum  in that order. It reminding me a lot from when I first started construction as an apprentice and didn't really know the trade, then learning each skills till I was able to join them all into one skill.  Now with Rails magic which is taking those folders, files and methods that we used and learn about up until now and getting us to the "developer's magic" part which saves a great amount of time to create to our imagination's content. Using the generator, the console and the server made me feel like a Rails magic magician. I decided to go with Devise to help write my Auth methods and  I'll be using Google as a third-party login/signup. I plan on using this project in the future in a similar way so I'm glad I get to test out the development while I'm learning to become a better coder.
