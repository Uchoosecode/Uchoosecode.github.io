I was both excited and nervous about this project. So let me tell you what I was nervous about first. I was nervous about having to speak about my code with coding terminalogy. I understand what I want my code to do, I just nervous of having to explain it out loud. I feel what helped me prepare for that part of this assessment the most is adding comments to my code. By giving short explainations about what specific lines of codes are doing will help me remember what I intended to do and how I best explain what it is doing.

I was excited cause the further into the process I go, the more I understand code and I'm started to feel more and more like a real programmer.  I've always instilled in my children that a taking actions towards your dreams will turn your dreams to reality.  So this feeling is me not telling my lessons but actually living it and that has me excited for what comes next and after that.

My project started out to be about Marvel Characters but accessing the API in ruby wasn't possible, so I went to the next best thing....Cannabis(A joke). So I created a Gem  that gives info on different strand of Cannabis. It was challenging, fun and informative.  Also pry has really become like my coding partner,  we code everything together, lol.
