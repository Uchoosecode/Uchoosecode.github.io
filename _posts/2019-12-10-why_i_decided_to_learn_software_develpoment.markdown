Ever since I was a kid, my mom bought us an IBM computer because I was always fanscinated by technology.  I even tried to teach myself MS-DOS, but they didn't have Google then and I didn't have anyone I could look to as a mentor to help me understand it.  I enjoy art and creation so I ended up going for my Assoiciate's Degree in Graphic Design.  During that course I get a preview of coding in HTML, CSS and Javascript and that's when I realized what part of the technology world I wanted to be a part of.  There's a saying that I always say to anyone who is thinking about pursuing anything the want, it goes, "In the journey of a thousand miles, you have to take a first step"!  Well I'm way past my first steps and I'm heading to my thousandth mile.
