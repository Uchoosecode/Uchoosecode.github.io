     I would be lying if I said I'm not a little nervous.  As in everything there are some topics I'm strong at and others I'm not as strong.  The labs definitely pushed me as I learned how to iterate and understand code. Areas like arrays and hashes start off simple, then you start adding hashes to array and/or arrays to hashes then it becomes more complex.  What's comforting is that everything done in coding is either in an array or a hash or a combination of both, for me understanding them is the most important. It's the tool box we use to collect and distribute information.
		 
    Well since we have a tool box, what are the tools we use?  The methods and iterations are the tools. Methods like, "if", "elsif", "else", "while", "each", "length" and "map" are methods that you are given.  Others like "all", "initialize", "send" and "save" are methods that you would have to iterate. So it's safe to say that the methods are the tools we use. In construction people say, "If you have all the right tools in a toolbox but you dont know how to use those tools.... then they're just that, tools in a box."  
		
		So I'm heading into this week with my tool box and a decent understanding of how to use most of those tools. What I'll need to practice is talking my code out loud so I feel comfortable enough to explain what I'm doing while I iterate.  Wish me luck and good luck to all my co-cohorts! You're gonna rock this!
