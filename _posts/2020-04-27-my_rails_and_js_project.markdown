My project is named about a flag.  When I first decided on this idea, it was about all the flags in the world. I planned on seeding **a lot** of data and joining the flag model with a country model, a continent model and a color model.  Though this information would've been useful I just felt that it lacked User interest and all the information can be looked up easily. Then while watching "Pirates of the Caribbean" with my family the idea change came to my mind. I thought if I was a pirate captain on my own ship I'd want my own flag.  Of course my wife had to burst my bubble like "modern pirates use speed boats", lol. So I thought what about a birthday present or family at reunions where they have different teams or a family insignia, those could be good reasons to create your own flag and that's what my project is about.  

"It's About A Flag", was fun yet challenging to code. i decided on the 3 main shapes the can basically make any shape which are circle, square and triangle.  I used the <canvas> script to create the layout for the canvas. Seems fitting, right? Well the <canvas> tags was the most challenging part of my process. Adding the shapes are tricky cause ever shape thats created is a layover on the shapes already on the canvas. Also creating the shapes using canvas methods such as fillRect() which is needed to fill your rectangle in conjunction with the fillStyle() method. The circle and triangles are create my starting a path and using x, y, coordinates to draw and the circle even uses the Math.PI method. Right now my project meets the Project requirements but its only in prototype project mode and upon graduation will get a complete makeover and functionality.
